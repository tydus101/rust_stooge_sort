# rust_stooge_sort
Rust is a blazingly fast language; too fast, some might say. Perhaps it needs a bit of a slowdown... 


This is an implementation of Stooge Sort in Rust. Stooge Sort is a very simple but ultimately 
very inefficient sorting algorithm. It has a time complexity of 
O(n^2.7095..), making it slower than even simple sorts
like bubble sort or insertion sort. It thus finds no 
use in any modern (or past) systems. However, it's simplistic 
nature and unique time complexity make it useful for educational
purposes.

To my knowledge, I am the first person to take up this task. Clearly we are treading historic ground here.
